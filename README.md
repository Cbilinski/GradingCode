# GradingCode used in many ASTR170 courses at the University of Arizona
MATLAB code, written entirely by me (Christopher Bilinski) executed through "TAcode", facilitates the grading process for quizzes and exams containing up to 100 questions. It offers flexibility to use different answer keys and allows for customizing color shading for different answer options. The code is capable of efficiently handling large batches of over 200 exams, including image straightening to correct slanted scans. Through a user-friendly GUI, it enables conversion of scanned PDFs to JPGs, creation or selection of answer keys, matching of student IDs to exam IDs, and comprehensive grading of quizzes/exams. The output includes detailed statistics such as percentile brackets and Point-biserial correlation coefficients for each question, providing valuable insights into student performance.  The exam form used by this code is included in examform.svg / pdf / png in this repository.  Feel free to contact at cgbilinsk@gmail.com with any questions or if you have the desire to make use of this for any project.
